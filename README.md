## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://jamessahunter.github.io/password-generator/)

The purpose of the project was to generate a random password when given certain criteria. These criteria were a length of between 8 and 128, contains uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters. The length of the password was entered into a prompt that the user was given. The rest of the criteria the user was given confirms as to whether or not the wanted to use those characters. This then generates a password of the desired length ensuring at least one of each selected character type is used. This project taught me how to alert, prompt, and confirm to the user. This porject also uses functions to breka the code up into more managable sections for debugging. This project also had me consider the edge case where the user does not follow the intended path such as not entering a number into the prompt or not selecting any criteria. Also the user is allowed to create a new password repeatedly.

## Usage

The user enters in their desired password length between 8 and 128 and accecpts or rejects the criteria of type of characters used. Then a password is generated and displayed on the page.
